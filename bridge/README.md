# Bridge

It is a good example for making a multi platform application samething with our example
and IDE that can compile any programming language.

It is also passed the Open/Closed Principle since we can just add new abstraction and implementation

It is also passed the  single responsibility principle since it only work about there own objects.

With Bridge It solves the problem in creating 4 Objects when we have 2 is to 2 requirements

Like Creating these objects:

JavaNetbeans
CppNetbeans
JavaEclipse
CppEclipse

Although we still have 4 objects but it separates the concern and its depencies of each objects.

Netbeans
Eclipse
Java
Cpp
